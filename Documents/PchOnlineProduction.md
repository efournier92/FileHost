# The PCH Online Production Team
### _Discussion with Patricia D'Souza_

## Introduction

**Goal:** _Have a discussion with any person outside of Spectrum/Nova teams, enquire about their project, and outline your understanding about their project in a document._

In considering whose team would be most interesting and relevant to learn about, I wanted to pick someone with a loose tie Spectrum, but I also wanted it to be someone on a team I wouldn't otherwise have gained exposure to. I settled on Patricia, since she has immersive experience in the world of PCH online production, and regularly interfaces with our PrismOps end users.

## Online Production

The online production department is divided in three sections. These sections are lead by Patricia, Carla, & Carol. Each of them report to Sal, who oversees Online Production.

Much like Carla leads the PrismOps team, Patricia head the emails team. Unlike Carla's team, who utilize our Spectrum admin tools on a daily basis, the emails team works primarily in the Experian admin tools. They also directly interact with PrismOps to provide landing paths, which are linked in their emails. 

## Exit Paths

Exit paths are a major consideration for the emails team. Much of the time, their emails will explicitly state that, upon entry, the customer will be redirected to a featured opportunity. Sometimes these exits redirect to external partner websites (_e.g. a special Geico offer_), while others redirect to internal PCH offerings. Exit paths are used across PCH Brands.

## PCH Brands

Online Production's efforts are divided into both sub-brands, and individual sites.

**PCH Sub-Brands**
* `PCH.com`
* `Outlet`
* `eCommerce`

**PCH Sites**
* `PCH.com`
* `Spectrum`
* `Lotto`
* `Keno`
* `Games`
* `Outlet`
* `Search & Win`
* `Play & Win`
* `Frontpage`

## Email Packages

The emails team works directly with the creative team in order to deliver new email content every day. Creative builds the packages that are ultimately used in the emails. In come cases, they create a brand new package from scratch. In others, they modify an existing package to promote a new contest or offering. Once the creative team delivers the package, Patricia's team starts preparing the email to be sent.

## Experian

Since Experian marketing services are used across PCH sites, customer data is readily available through that platform. The emails team primarily uses CheetahMail, which is a powerful tool provided by Experian. CheetahMail enables Patricia's team to tweak each email, based on known customer affinity & preference. Such tweaks can include rewording the subject line, altering the offer description, and including the user's name in the ad copy.

## Simple Paths

Simple paths consist of only a contest entry page, and an exit path redirect. The emails team builds their own simple paths. However, when it comes to anything product or lineup related, the emails team puts in a request with Carla's team, who subsequently build the new path.

## Incremental Efforts

At minimum, the emails team sends out nine unique emails each day (one for each PCH site). Additionally, out sites often run campaigns that require incremental efforts, which come in addition to the routine daily emails. Typically, at least one incremental effort is scheduled for each day.

The PCH VIP program requires frequent incremental emails, with special promotions offered exclusively to our VIP members. The goal is for VIPs get a different email, from a different PCH site, each day. In these cases, PrismOps admins often must build a unique landing path for each incremental effort. They do the same for cross-promotions, when a Spectrum URL is featured on an email from a different PCH site.

PCH has started doing more event campaigns recently, which have proven to be very successful. Most special events also require incremental emails. For example, `Search & Win`'s `12 Days of Prizes` promotion will require an additional email for 12 days in a row.

Whenever any site under the PCH brand runs a special promotion, they require Patricia's team to support that incremental effort. These efforts add up, many days making her team responsible for over a dozen emails.

## QA Testing

Once the emails team uses CheetahMail to combine Creative's package with marketing's ad copy, it goes through an initial onshore QA test. They subsequently offshore the email to Softcrylic QA analysts, who thoroughly test each email by clicking each link, and ensuring each exit path is redirecting appropriately. If they find any issues, Patricia's team will fix them, then send it back offshore for retesting. It's a back and forth process, until QA is ready to sign off on it, at which point the emails team performs a delivery test. 

## Delivery Testing

Delivery testing helps predict whether an email will be placed in the client's inbox, or spam folder. This is an important step, as they want to ensure the email goes to users' inboxes as frequently as possible. They call the issue of being filtered as spam `bulking`. The emails team uses a third party tool, which give them an accurate impression of whether an email will be marked spam, in a variety of email clients. The test results are reported as data is reported, which is analyzed by Patricia's team.

When the delivery test reveals potential bulking issues, the emails team methodically breaks the email in tiny pieces, in an effort to isolate the specific piece causing the bulking. They proceed to dig further, to find which word, or combination of words, is triggering the spam filter.

The contest disclaimer at the bottom of each email is the most frequent cause of bulking issues. This creates a dilemma, since we legally must include that disclaimer. The simplest solution is to convert the disclaimer from raw ad copy, to an image. However, Patricia must obtain permission from our legal team, before any such conversion is performed.

## Spam Filters

Staying ahead of these spam filters is one of the largest challenges faced by the emails team. Since each email client has its own spam filtering rules, which are constantly changing, the emails team is in a perpetual cat and mouse game, whereby they need to make regular adjustments just to keep our emails out of users' spam folders. Many email clients also adjust their spam rules based on the time of year, so holiday time can be especially problematic when it comes to bulking issues. For this reason, each delivery test must cast a wide net when it comes to testing different email clients. In terms of bulking, the Gmail spam filter is the most likely to mark PCH emails as spam.

## Deep Linking

The emails team routinely experiments with new tools tools and techniques, to make their emails more compelling. This year, they have started using deep linking techniques in their emails. This allows mobile users to be dynamically redirected to either the website, or the mobile app, depending on whether the PCH app is installed on their device. Since we get more advertising dollars from the mobile app than from the website, this seemingly small change should increase revenue in the long run.

## Last Steps

The day before an email is scheduled to go out, the emails team will pick their audience, based on whom Marketing wants to reach on that particular day. They'll also do one final round of QA testing, to ensure that no delivery testing changes caused any links to break. They also ensure that all variables, such as the user's name, are still populating correctly. Once everything looks good, they put it on a timer via CheetahMail, and it is delivered to customers en masse at the predefined time.
